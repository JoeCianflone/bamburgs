#Bamburgs
##A Sane Frontend Toolkit for your Projects

###Introduction
Bamburgs? What the hell is a bamburg? Funny story. Bambergers was a department store that was bought out by Macy's in the very early 80's. I believe it was a regional store, so folks like me, in NJ, might have heard about this place. When I was a kid, the store didn't exist anymore. But, the mall that it was attached to was still there. So, as a kid, I would go to the mall with my dad. When we went to the mall, she would always ask if we were "going to Bamburgs" because she was fresh off the boat Italian, her accent was a bit thick. For years, I had no idea WTF "Bamburgs" was, but I knew that if we were going to the mall we were essentially going to Bamburgs.

So it just became a thing.

When I needed a name for this thing, it was the first thing that popped into my name and it's funny because it sorta works. Bambergers was a department store where you could find everything you needed. Bamburgs is a toolkit...a sorta front end department store where you find everything you need to build up a site.

Thanks Nanna :)
