## A Sane Frontend Toolkit for your Projects
So the other day I was lamenting the fact that I had to learn *yet another* front end tooling thing and I realized that I just don't want to do it. Front end development is in this strange space right now where everyone and their mom is writing a new gulp or webpack replacement and I'm just tired of it.

I've started this project with the idea that everything I need can be done with NPM scripts. I know this is true because all gulp/grunt/webpack are--are essentially wrappers over NPM. So, this is my attempt at making something that is sane and can do exactly what I need it to do.

I've got plans to add more stuff, but for right now here's what you get:

1. Sass/PostCSS compilation
2. Linting
3. Image Minification
4. Spriting
5. Watchers
6. VueJS Integration
7. A sane default Sass Structure
8. Transpiling JS w/Babel
